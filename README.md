# User interface [modeling language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language)

UIML (not to be confounded by user interface markup language), is a set of platform neutral artificial languages used to develop scalable graphical user interface.

It notably uses states and styles to provide an highly customizable and modulable environment.

## Motivation
I created this standard as a guideline to create my own native, portable, multi-platform user interface engine and want to share my work to the open source community.

## Section
* component
* style
* localization
* view
* definition

## Inspirations
Those section were inspired by those language :
* C++ for definition
* Rust for components
* CSS for styles
* XML for views
* Android for localization

## Version
TBD : Currently developping the standard.
