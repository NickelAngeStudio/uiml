# Properties

Properties are flag use to modify appearance and/or values. 

**Important : properties only works with component that declares them.** *That means that component that doesn't declare visible will never be draw.*

There is a total of 64 possibles distinct properties. 48 are reserved, the rest is available to the developper. The limit is made to be able to use bit shifting for better performance.

## Summary
Implied properties are added to component by default. They can be removed using `!` in front of their name.

## Details

### visible
Component is visible which mean that it will be draw. This property is `on` by default when added and must be toggled manually. Invisible components cannot be interected with.

### enabled
Component is enabled and can be interacted with. This property is `on` by default when added and must be toggled manually. Disabled components are still visible.

### readonly
Component can be interacted with but custom attributes cannot be changed. This property is `off` by default when added, can be toggled manually and must be `on` when using read only data adapter.

### Adapter
Component uses a data adapter. This property becomes `on` automatically when the adapter `@` reference is used when defining view.

### connected
Component data adapter is connected to data source. It is important to query that this bit is `on` before querying data adapter.

### hover
Mouse is over the component. This property becomes `on` when the mouse enter the component then `off` when the mouse leaves the component.

### focus
Component can be focused to receive input. Becomes `on` when focus is received and `off` when component is blurred.

**Parent component always inherit child `focus`.**

### mouse
Component can receive mouse input like mouse button down, scroll, etc... When `on`, you must query the mouse state to get which buttons are down and/or acivated. [See input](TODO_LINK)

### keyboard
