# Propriétés

Properties are flag use to modify appearance and/or values. Properties are only added to component that declare them.

There is a total of 64 possibles distinct properties per component. 32 are reserved, the rest is available to the developper. The limit is to be able to use bit shifting for better performance.

## Implied properties
Those properties are added to all component by default.

### **visible**
Component will be drawed only if this flag is added.

Those properties already come with their rules and are use to automate interactions.

### **hover**
